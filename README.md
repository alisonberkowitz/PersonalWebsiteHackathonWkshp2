## Workshop 2: Responsive Design and Bootstrap

####What is Responsive Design?
Designing your website to look good across multiple screen sizes and therefore multiple devices.
- If you want to read more about it, the concept was introduced in 2010 in [this A List Apart Article](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)

#####Examples of Good Responsive Design
 - find these

####Bootstrap
[getbootstrap.com](getbootstrap.com)

*“Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.”*

#####Use Bootstrap in your personal website
1. Go to the "Getting Started" section of the website
2. Scroll down to where it says 'Bootstrap CDN' and copy and paste that snippet of code into your index.html file header
* this is the quickest way to do it, but in terms of performance, you may want to eventually download the files and save them in your website's directory
* for now referencing the CDN is good enough
3. Use whatever Bootstrap components you like in your website
